## To-do List

## Refocus (!)
- Using the new profit curve generated by the slide bar:
    ~~- Generate new profit curve~~
    ~~- Find the line using the data~~
    ~~- Find where the slope of the line equals zero~~
    ~~- Show max of profit curve~~
    ~~- Pass threshold to model to use for predictions~~
    ~~- Generate form that takes inputs to make predictions~~
    ~~- Display recommendations~~


#### Deployment
- ~~Add a route to my website that will display the dashboard.~~
- ~~Add projects section for capstone that links to the new route. (Likely need Miles help for this.)~~
- Deploy tools to evaluate model performance in real time.

#### Backend
- ~~Add flask routes for slide bar change calculations.~~

#### Frontend
- ~~Add JS script for ajax request to route, perform calculation, return modified data.~~
- ~~Add bootstrap or other theme.~~
- ~~Add descriptions.~~
- ~~Figure out what all I want to show on the dashboard.~~
- ~~Figure out D3 transitions.~~

#### Modeling
- ~~Pipelines~~
- ~~Initial data exploration~~
- ~~crappy models built~~
- Splines
- ~~Scalers~~ N/A

#### GitHub
- Readme write up. A _good_ one.
