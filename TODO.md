## To-do List

#### Deployment
- Add a route to my website that will display the dashboard.
- Add projects section for capstone that links to the new route. (Likely need Miles help for this.)
- Deploy tools to evaluate model performance in real time.

#### Backend
- Add flask routes for slide bar change calculations.
- Database management from the page.
- Login, authentication.

#### Frontend
- Add JS script for ajax request to route, perform calculation, return modified data.
- Consider doing all calculations on the front end.
- Add bootstrap or other theme.
- Add descriptions.
- Figure out what all I want to show on the dashboard.
- Figure out D3 transitions.

#### Modeling
- Pipelines
- Splines
- Scalers

#### GitHub
- Readme write up. A _good_ one.
